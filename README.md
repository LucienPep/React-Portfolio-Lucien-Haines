### Work Description
I Started by installing react and sketching out roughly what I wanted the webpage to look like. After deciding on a design I build the base page and added in the pictures and titles, next I added a basic a tag nav bar and looked into react routes. After practicing with react routes I implemented them into my webpage and started working on basic page layout. From there I wanted to add animations to teh pages and make the website visually appealing. I then started on the skills and resume page which later I combined as I felt there was little need for two individual pages. I then worked on the contact box section and found a useful add on called validator which allowed me to validate correct emails on my contact form. After that I added in the project tabs my six recent projects an image to go with them and associated links. Unfortunately due to time constraints I was not able to add full webpage sizing functionality but used media queries instead to make the webpage usable at smaller screen sizes, I plan to fix this in my own time later.
